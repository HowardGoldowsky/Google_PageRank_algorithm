PageRank and Personalized PageRank
Sample call:
[iter, importanceVector] = pagerank(G, m, tolerence, max_iter)

G is a MATLAB directed graph object. 
m can typically be 0.15, which is the value used in the original paper.
tolerence start with 1e-10; this is the length of the difference between successive iterations of the importance vector
